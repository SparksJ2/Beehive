````````
'cubi id != their place in the roster, leading to off-by-one problems

todo list:
```````````

cheat: clear all nectar.

cheat: override FOV to see all map.

bug report: arrow keys can lose main window focus?
	``Interesting. Somehow hitting ← got me into one of the display-text-boxes, and now I can't control the interface anymore``
	``Mono probably has a bug around this. I noticed intermittent weirdness around the feedback box last time I ran (won't build right now, will debug later) that I couldn't make clear enough to give you a bug report about.``
	misfeature: do something with ctrl/shift key chording?

random chase questions:
	can BE detect pet via any 6th sense?
	can pet be tracked around corners by her glow?
	can pet dynamic entry if she gets excited enough?

fix dodgy animation coding
	(throwing has glitches when going over holding pens,
	also needs to redraw player char after throw release)

low priority:
``````````````
config file settings
weight allowance
2 player mode
learn javascript, lol
find a RichTextBox substitute if possible

further notes
``````````````
the current lust cycle is: player chases 'cubi > 'cubi gets horny > 'cubi leaks nectar >
player touching nectar consumes it > player gets horny > player spontaneous orgasm >
player leaks nectar > 'cubi paths to player nectar > 'cubi touching nectar consumes it >
'cubi gets more horny > 'cubi spontaneous orgasm > 'cubi nectar leaks > (etc...)

tease theory
`````````````
while player is distant or not closing in 'cubi bored++
when subtract bored from target distance to player
when too close, spook, set bored = 0 and set target distance far again

for reference
`````````````
amusing bug: pillow-dodging frees ms. 'cubi from the bed' - 'motivation!'
