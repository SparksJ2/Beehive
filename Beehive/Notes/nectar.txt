nectar spreading rules
```````````````````````

goal state:
	max of 8 nectar total per tile (not 'overloaded')
	no more than one type of nectar per tile (not 'stacked')

combined mechanism:
	if this tile is 'overloaded' or 'stacked':
		look at the surrounding tiles
		and from the rarest nectar type here, 
		push a dot out to a randomly chosen suitable tile

key:
	overloaded = (more than 8 nectar total)
	suitable = (empty || (unstacked && correct color))
	stacked = (more than one type of nectar here)
