the current lust cycle is: player chases cubi > cubi gets horny > cubi leaks nectar >
player touching nectar consumes it > player gets horny > player spontaneous orgasm >
player leaks nectar > cubi paths to player nectar > cubi touching nectar consumes it >
cubi gets more horny > cubi spontaneous orgasm > cubi nectar leaks > (e.t.c....)

`````````````
while player is distant or not closing in, cubi bored++
when subtract bored from target distance to player
when too close, spook, set bored = 0 and set target distance far again
